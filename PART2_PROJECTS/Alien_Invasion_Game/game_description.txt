Project Planning:
In this project, I'll use a third-library modules "Pygame". To
use modules, we need to install the Pygame module.

First, we need to create an empty window to which we can later
draw our game elements, such as ship and the alien. We can also
set the background color and load a ship and alien image.

Game Description:
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
'space bar'. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
